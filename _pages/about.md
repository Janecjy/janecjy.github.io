Welcome to my personal website! I'm Jiayi Chen, but you can call me Jane. Currently, I'm pursuing my PhD in Computer Science at UT Austin, where I have the privilege of being co-advised by Prof. [Aditya Akella](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~akella/) and Prof. [Sanjay Shakkottai](https://sites.google.com/view/sanjay-shakkottai/). Prior to that, I proudly earned my bachelor degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

My research interest lies in the fascinating intersection of machine learning, networks, and systems. In particular, I've worked on <ins>applying machine learning techniques to enhance the performance of network and system</ins>, and <ins>optimizing systems to seamlessly accommodate the demands of machine learning workloads</ins>. I am proud to be part of the [Learning-Directed Operating System (LDOS)](https://ldos.utexas.edu) project.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find my work as exciting as I do!
