* I proudly belong to the house of Ravenclaw. ![Ravenclaw](https://github.com/Janecjy/janecjy.github.io/blob/master/images/ravenclaw.png?raw=true)
* While I may be an expert spectator when it comes to soccer, my skills on the field are still at an amateur level. I'm a devoted Kop and you can often find me at B.D. Riley's on match days, cheering passionately for my team ヽ(•‿•)ノ. YNWA!
* I have a deep passion for musicals. Prior to embarking on my PhD journey, I had the pleasure of working at [@Sevenages](https://weibo.com/7ages?refer_flag=1005055013_) and [@Focustage](https://weibo.com/u/6582303814), where I immersed myself in the world of theater. Some of my all-time favorites include Les Misérables, The Lion King, Next to Normal, and Wicked.
* Annually, I make it a ritual to revisit the captivating worlds of Lord of the Rings and Doctor Who. I should note that I tend to avoid episodes featuring weeping angels – they can't escape from my screen if I don't watch them!
* In my free time, I find solace in playing the piano and creating oil paintings.
