* I proudly belong to the house of [Ravenclaw](https://www.wizardingworld.com/collections/ravenclaw). ![Ravenclaw](https://github.com/Janecjy/janecjy.github.io/blob/master/images/ravenclaw.png?raw=true)
* While I may be an expert spectator when it comes to soccer, my skills on the field are still at an amateur level. I'm a devoted [Kop](https://www.liverpoolfc.com/) and you can often find me at B.D. Riley's@Austin on match days, cheering passionately for my team ヽ(•‿•)ノ. YNWA! ![Anfield](https://github.com/Janecjy/janecjy.github.io/blob/master/images/anfield.jpg?raw=true)
* I have a deep passion for musicals. Prior to embarking on my PhD journey, I had the pleasure of working at [@Sevenages](https://weibo.com/7ages?refer_flag=1005055013_) and [@Focustage](https://weibo.com/u/6582303814), where I immersed myself in the world of theater. Some of my all-time favorites include [Les Misérables](https://www.lesmis.com/), [The Lion King](https://lionking.com/tickets/?gclid=CjwKCAjw6p-oBhAYEiwAgg2Pgk6wRs4C6U2RDJLEPOfoVzSGDi2hnXNUEOSLC67XO1b4Qaj2NZAavRoCF7oQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds), [Next to Normal](https://playbill.com/production/next-to-normal-booth-theatre-vault-0000001652), [Rent](https://playbill.com/production/rent-nederlander-theatre-vault-0000002708), [Matilda](https://us.matildathemusical.com/) and [Wicked](https://wickedthemusical.com/).
* Annually, I make it a ritual to revisit the captivating worlds of [the Lord of the Rings](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings) and [Doctor Who](https://www.doctorwho.tv/). I should note that I tend to avoid episodes featuring weeping angels – they can't escape from my screen if I don't watch them!
* In my free time, I find solace in playing the piano and creating oil paintings.
